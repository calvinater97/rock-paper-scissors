# Overview

* This software displays a map centered on the United States and shows different climbing locations while giving a brief description about each location.  I was able to attain this data from various locations that I have been climbing too and also by using the app mountain project to help provide me with more locations of interest.

* The purpose of this software is to provide the user with some different climbing locations they can travel too and to help them have an idea of the amount of different routes available at each location.

# Development Environment

* In order for me to develop this software I used the ArcGIS library which provided me with examples of code and also walkthroughs of how I can the software to the point it is today.  I was able to find some code that allowed me to create a custom layer which I used for my code and then edited it to make it work for my map.  The programming language that I used is Javascript mainly and also have a little html and css.
